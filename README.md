Get bounding boxes and names in several languages for countries

## Bounding Boxes

I created a jupyter notebook for Python 3. To get the bounding boxes I used this package: [country-bounding-boxes 0.2.3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/country-bounding-boxes/0.2.3).

## Country names

To get all the names in German and English I used this npm package: [i18n-iso-countries](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18n-iso-countries). 

Just run `npm install` and then you can add the country codes you are interested in.
